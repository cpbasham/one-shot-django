<h1>One_Shot</h1>
<h4>The League of Legends Item Set Creator</h4>
<br>
<p>This project was originally built for the Riot LoL (League of Legends) API Challenge 2.0.  It has been ported from a Ruby/Sinatra app and is now currently running on Python/Django.</p>

<p>The goal of this app is to create an online LoL item-set builder that will provide people more options and information than the in-game builder.  At the moment, it falls short of that goal.  However, this is only the MVP for what I hope to build into a much larger project.</p>

<h6>How It Works</h6>
<p>The workflow in One_Shot is fairly simple.  A user must first log in or register before moving on to their profile (which currently is just a list of their item sets).  From there they can edit or delete existing sets, or create a new one.  Creating or editing a set will take them to the main editor page.  This page is the meat of the app, and all of its communication with the server is done through AJAX in order to make One_Shot mostly function as a single-page app.</p>
